**OVERVIEW** 

bamazonCustomer.js - A *Node.js* & *MySQL* command line Amazon-like storefront app that takes in a customers' order and depletes stock from the store Inventory. 

bamazonManager.js -  - A *Node.js* & *MySQL* command line manager app that allows viewing, adding stock to, and creating
new inventory

** INSTRUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMER **

The database is called 'bamazon' with a Table called 'products'. MySQL WorkBench file create_bamazon_database.sql included.

Running the Node application called 'bamazonCustomer.js' will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, prices and quantities of products for sale.

Bamazon then prompts users with two messages: 

	* The first ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy. 
	* The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once an order has been placed the application checks to see if the store has enough of the product to meet the user's request. *If not*, the app logs the insufficient stock message and asks the item ID again.

However, if the store *does* have enough of the product, it will fulfill the userâ€™s order showing the total price of the order as well as updating the MySQL database to reflect the new quantity. 

It will then ask if you would like to continue shopping, repeating the process above.  If the customer is asked if they would like to continue shopping and selects *no*, the app will exit.

** INSTRUCTIONS FOR MANAGER **

This uses the same database as the *CUSTOMER* app, bamazon with the same table, products.

Running the Node application called 'bamazonManager.js' application will first display a selection menu of what the manager can do.

	* View products for sale - only those in stock
	* View low inventory - those items with less than 5 in stock
	* Add to inventory - add stock to any item
	* Add new product - insert a new product in to the bamazon database

*View producs for sale* simply lists all product available where at least 1 is in stock.
*View low inventory* will show any item with less than 5 in stock, including 0 in stock.
*Add to inventory* allows manager to add stock to any item, including those with 0 in stock. 
*Add new product* allows manager to insert a new item with relevant info.

Once the manager is done managing, the Quit Menu option is selected to exit the app.
